        <p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997.
            They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer
            Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.[3] They met at University College London and began playing
            music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish.

            After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The
            band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single "Yellow" and received a Brit Award
            for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize
            nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included
            "Clocks", which earned a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2005, they released X&Y; the album was
            marked by a troubled production and various delays, completing what the band considered a trilogy as well.
            Coldplay's fourth effort, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), received a Grammy Award for Best
            Rock Album and their first Album of the Year nomination, while its title track was the first British group
            song to reach number-one in the United Kingdom and United States simultaneously in the 21st century. Both
            X&Y and Viva la Vida were the best-selling albums of their respective years, topping the charts in more than
            30 countries each.
        </p> 
        <p>Coldplay further diversified their sound with Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A
            Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a
            unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient,
            pop, R&B, classical, and progressive rock. They are also known for "euphoric" and "immersive" live
            performances,[4] which NME stated are when the band "come alive and make the most sense".[5] In 2018, a
            career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in select cinemas.

            With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are the most successful band of the 21st century and one of
            the best-selling music acts of all time.[b] According to Fuse, they are also the sixth-most awarded group in
            history. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50
            highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom's history, the most number-one albums in the country without
            ever missing the top,[8] the most Brit Award nominations and wins for a band, and becoming the first British
            group to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential
            bands of the 21st century as well, with Forbes describing them as the standard for the current alternative
            scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their "200 Definitive Albums"
            list and the single "Yellow" is part of their "Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibition for being one of
            the most successful and important recordings in the industry. In spite of their popularity and impact,
            Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.
